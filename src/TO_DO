TO DO IN THIS PROJECT :

1. **Implement Raycasting:**
   - Cast rays from the player's position, one for each vertical stripe on the screen.  // done
   - Calculate the distance to the nearest wall for each ray.
   - Use these distances to determine the height of the wall slice to draw, creating a pseudo-3D effect.

2. **Calculate Wall Heights:**
   - Use the distance from the raycast to determine how tall to draw each wall slice.
   - Correct for fish-eye distortion by adjusting the distance based on the angle between the ray and the player's view direction.

3. **Draw the Walls:**
   - For each ray, draw a vertical line with the height based on the calculated distance.
   - Apply textures or colors to walls based on their orientation or type.

4. **Implement Player Movement & Controls:**
   - Allow the player to move forward, backward, and turn left/right.
   - Update the player's position and direction accordingly.

5. **Add Floor and Ceiling:**
   - Render the floor and ceiling to complete the scene, often by filling regions below and above the walls.

6. **Optimize & Add Effects (Optional):**
   - Add shading for depth.
   - Implement sprites and objects.
   - Handle input for a smoother experience.

Would you like me to help you with a specific part of this process, like writing the raycasting function or handling player movement?
